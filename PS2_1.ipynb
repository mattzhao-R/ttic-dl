The experiments in this assignment will take a long time to run without a GPU, but you can run the notebook remotely on Google Colab and have access to GPUs for free -- in this case you don't have to worry about installing PyTorch as it is available by default in Google Colab's environment.\n",

        "Unlike previous assignments, in this one you will have to do some writing instead of just coding. Try to keep your answers short and precise, and you are encouraged to write equations if needed (you can do that using markdown cells). You can also use code as part of your answers (like plotting and printing, etc). Blue text indicates questions or things that you should discuss/comment, and there will red \"ANSWER (BEGIN)\" and \"ANSWER (END)\" markdown cells to indicate that you should add cells with your writeup between these two. **Make sure not to redefine variables or functions in your writeup, which can change the behavior of the next cells.**\n",

You can post on piazza if there's a major, non-trivial change that you had to do (so other students can be aware of it and how to proceed), but for minor changes you should just apply them and keep working on the assignment."

The literature describes various reasons why batch normalization works, ranging from preventing \"internal covariate shift\" to smoothing the objective function which improves the reliability of gradient descent. My intuition is that by preserving the distribution of the output from one linear threshold to the next, batch normalization allows the weights to consistently learn from the same distribution. Adding residual connections without this distribution preservation results in an exploding/vanishing gradient problem as the distribution of inputs to the ELU/activation function layer is inconsistent which quickly becomes a problem with deeper models. Hence residual connections without batch normalization is challenging."

The network should output three logit vectors (the original one at the end of the network plus the two new ones) instead of just one, and the loss should be computed as the average of the cross entropies between the true target and each of the three predictions.\n",
